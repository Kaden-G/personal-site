    <p class="text-sm md:text-base text-[#4B5563]">
      I like building small, interactive things: games, tools, and AI-adjacent experiments that make complex systems feel simple.
      Most of my work lives somewhere between infrastructure, data, and playful UI.
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm md:text-base text-[#4B5563]">
      I'm especially interested in how lightweight models and good design can help teams work faster without adding
      cognitive load. Sometimes that looks like a log query helper. Sometimes it's a goofy blackjack game. Either way,
      the goal is the same: does it feel good to use?
    </p>
    <p class="text-sm md:text-base text-[#4B5563]">
      Outside of work, I'm usually tinkering with small programs, trying new tools, or wandering around in nature
      thinking about the next weird little experiment to ship.
